Supply chain tracking using solidity

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
#install next.js
npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest

#install hardhat, ether.js version 5.7.2 and web3modal version 1.9.12
npm i hardhat
npm i ethers@5.7.2
npm i web3modal@1.9.12

#testing hardhat 
npx hardhat node

#deploy the smartcontract to localhost
npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
```
```
